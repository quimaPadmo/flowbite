# How to Use Keygen (SAP R3 License and Object Key Generator v 2.0) to Hack SAP Systems
 
If you are looking for a way to bypass the developer and object keys in SAP systems, you might have come across a tool called Keygen (SAP R3 License and Object Key Generator v 2.0). This tool claims to generate valid keys for any SAP system, allowing you to modify or create any ABAP code without authorization. But is it safe and reliable? And how do you use it?
 
## What is Keygen (SAP R3 License and Object Key Generator v 2.0)?
 
Keygen (SAP R3 License and Object Key Generator v 2.0) is an executable file that was developed by a company called IWR. It has a description of "SAP R/3 License and Object Key Generator" and a version of 1.1.0.0[^1^]. It is supposed to generate developer keys and object keys for any SAP system, regardless of the version or patch level.

Developer keys and object keys are codes that SAP uses to protect its standard code from unauthorized changes. They are required when you want to create or modify ABAP objects in the SAP system. Normally, you have to request these keys from SAP through the SSCR (SAP Software Change Registration) procedure[^2^]. However, some people use Keygen (SAP R3 License and Object Key Generator v 2.0) to generate these keys without contacting SAP.
 
## How to Use Keygen (SAP R3 License and Object Key Generator v 2.0)?
 
To use Keygen (SAP R3 License and Object Key Generator v 2.0), you need to download it from the internet and unzip it. Then, you need to run it in Windows 7 compatibility mode[^3^]. You will see a window like this:
