# Limits Fits And Tolerances: An Overview of Engineering Metrology
 
Limits fits and tolerances are important concepts in engineering metrology, which is the science of measurement and its application to engineering. Limits fits and tolerances define the allowable variation in dimensions and geometry of parts that are intended to work together in an assembly. They ensure that the parts can be manufactured and assembled with minimum cost and maximum reliability.
 
Limits are the maximum and minimum permissible sizes of a dimension, such as diameter, length, width, etc. They are expressed as upper limit (UL) and lower limit (LL). For example, a hole with a nominal diameter of 10 mm may have a lower limit of 9.98 mm and an upper limit of 10.02 mm.

Fits are the degree of tightness or looseness between two mating parts, such as a shaft and a hole. They are classified into three types: clearance fit, interference fit, and transition fit. Clearance fit allows some clearance or gap between the parts. Interference fit requires some force or pressure to assemble or disassemble the parts. Transition fit may have either clearance or interference depending on the actual sizes of the parts.
 
Tolerances are the permissible variation in dimensions from the nominal or desired value. They are expressed as a plus or minus value from the nominal size. For example, a shaft with a nominal diameter of 10 mm may have a tolerance of Â±0.01 mm, meaning that its actual diameter can vary from 9.99 mm to 10.01 mm.
 
Limits fits and tolerances are determined by various factors, such as function, performance, interchangeability, manufacturability, cost, etc. They are specified by using standard codes and symbols based on international standards, such as ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and ANSI (American National Standards Institute). For example, H7/g6 is a code for a hole-shaft pair with a clearance fit, where H7 is the tolerance grade for the hole and g6 is the tolerance grade for the shaft.
 
Limits fits and tolerances are measured by using various instruments and methods, such as linear measuring instruments (e.g., steel rule, vernier caliper, micrometer), angular measuring instruments (e.g., protractor, bevel gauge, sine bar), surface finish measuring instruments (e.g., stylus probe, optical profilometer), screw thread measuring instruments (e.g., thread gauge, pitch micrometer), gear measuring instruments (e.g., gear tooth vernier, involute tester), interferometry (e.g., laser interferometer), comparators (e.g., mechanical comparator, electrical comparator), etc.
 
Limits fits and tolerances are essential for ensuring the quality and functionality of engineering products and systems. They help to reduce errors, defects, failures, wastage, rework, etc. They also facilitate mass production, standardization, interchangeability, etc. Therefore, limits fits and tolerances are important topics in engineering metrology that every engineer should know.
