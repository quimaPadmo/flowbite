- Choose your side wisely. Each side has different powers, units, and buildings, as well as different advantages and disadvantages. For example, God's powers are more defensive and healing-oriented, while the Devil's powers are more offensive and destructive. God's units are more expensive but stronger, while the Devil's units are cheaper but weaker. God's buildings are more durable but slower to build, while the Devil's buildings are faster but more fragile.
- Use your powers strategically. Each power has a cost and a cooldown time, so you need to plan when and where to use them. Some powers are more effective in certain situations than others. For example, God's rain power can extinguish fires and heal plants, while the Devil's fire power can burn buildings and crops. Some powers can also counter each other, such as God's lightning power and the Devil's shield power.
- Manage your resources carefully. You need three resources to build and use your powers: faith, souls, and mana. Faith is generated by your temples and shrines, and is used to build new structures and activate some powers. Souls are collected from the mortals who die or convert to your side, and are used to create new units and activate some powers. Mana is generated by your units and buildings, and is used to activate most of your powers. You need to balance your resource production and consumption, as well as protect your resource sources from enemy attacks.
- Explore the map and complete the objectives. Each map has different terrain features, such as mountains, rivers, forests, villages, etc., that can affect your gameplay. For example, mountains can block your line of sight and movement, rivers can slow down your units and powers, forests can provide cover and resources, villages can provide souls and faith, etc. You need to scout the map and find the best locations for your buildings and units, as well as discover hidden secrets and bonuses. You also need to complete the main objective of each mission, which can vary from converting a certain number of souls, destroying the enemy's temples, or performing miracles and curses.

Heaven And Hell - Live and Let Die is a fun and challenging strategy game that will test your divine skills and creativity. Whether you choose to play as God or the Devil, you will have a blast unleashing your powers and influencing the mortals. If you are looking for a retro strategy game with a twist, you should give Heaven And Hell - Live and Let Die a try.
