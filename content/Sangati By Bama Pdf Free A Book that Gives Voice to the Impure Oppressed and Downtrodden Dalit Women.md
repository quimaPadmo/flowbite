## A Brief Summary and Analysis of Sangati by Bama
  
Sangati is a novel that tells the stories of various Dalit women from different generations, from Bama's grandmother to Bama herself. The novel does not have a linear plot or a single protagonist, but rather a collection of voices that narrate their experiences of oppression, violence, discrimination, and resistance. The novel also shows how Dalit women are better placed than caste-Hindu women in some ways, as they have more freedom and agency in their lives.
  
The novel is divided into 12 chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of Dalit women's lives, such as childhood, education, marriage, work, religion, politics, etc. The novel also explores the themes of identity, self-esteem, solidarity, empowerment, and liberation among Dalit women. The novel challenges the hegemony of non-Dalit women writers who claim to speak for Dalit women, as well as that of Dalit men who oppress Dalit women.
  
The novel is written in a non-conventional language that mixes Tamil dialects with English words and phrases. The language reflects the oral tradition of Dalit culture and the hybridity of Dalit identity. The language also serves as a tool of resistance and expression for Dalit women who are often silenced by dominant discourses.
